<h1>Beginner Embroidery</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/embbear.png" alt="embroidery" style="width:450px"/>
</br></br>
What You Will Need: 
</br></br>
Embroidery Floss </br>
Embroidery Hoop </br>
Any Fabric </br>
Sewing Needle </br>
Scissors </br>
A Pencil </br></br>

Embroidery is extremely simple. Grab your fabric. This can be bought at a fabric store or thrift shop and can include old linens, shirts, lace, etcetera. The above was embroidered onto lace overlaid on top of an old tablecloth. Secure your fabric into the hoop by loosening the screw at the top of the hoop, laying in the fabric, replacing the inner hoop, and tightening it up. 
</br></br>
Pull about three feet of floss and split the individual strings so that you have two three foot lengths with three strands in each. Feed your three strand cluster into the needle. Double Knot one end, but leave the other loose. 
</br></br>
Now the fun part! 
</br></br>
Decide on what pattern, saying, or image you would like to embroider and sketch it lightly onto your fabric with the pencil. You can also buy embroidery iron on pattern books at many craft stores. 
</br></br>
Once you have got your idea, simply feed your needle through starting from the back of the fabric through the front to conceal the knot you’ve made. There are many books and YouTube tutorials on different techniques but it’s also fun to just experiment. 
</br></br>
Once you’ve finished, tie off the floss on the backside of the piece and trim the excess. Feel free to leave your work in the hoop or take it out and use it as a wall hanging, pillowcase, or whatever else you can think of.
</br></br>
Happy Embroidering!

<div id="bunt">
<h1>Yarn Bunting</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/IMG_0598.JPG" alt="yarn balls" style="width:450px"/>
</br></br>
What You Will Need
</br></br>
Twine</br>
Elmers Glue</br>
Paint</br>
Water</br>
Balloons</br>
News Paper</br>
Plastic Wrap</br>
Wall hooks</br></br>

To start off, measure the length you want the bunting to be. Make sure to take into account the length needed to form the dips down. 
</br></br>
Blow up a bunch of balloons. For my room, I blew up about 25. Spread out your newspaper to keep things clean.
</br></br>
Now mix up your water, glue, and paint solution. Start off with the water and glue. Mix about a quarter cup of water and half a cup of glue. You can also use Modpodge. Now add the paint until you get the color you want. As long as the mixture is not too gloopy and not to watery, it will work. 
</br></br>
Pull about five feet of twine and dip it into the mixture. As you pull it out, press it between your fingers to get off the excess and slowly start wrapping it around the balloon. Set the wrapped balloon down on the plastic wrap and let it dry overnight. 
</br></br>
Pop and gently pull out the balloons from the now hard twine balls. String them up with your leftover twine making sure to knot each ball into place to prevent them from clumping together. 
</br></br>
Happy Crafting!

<div id="crown">
<h1>Flower Crown</h1>
<p >
<img src="img/crown.png" alt="crown" style="width:450px"  />
</br></br>
What You Will Need
</br></br>
Flower Wire</br>
Fake Flowers</br>
Fake Leaves</br>
2 inch Thick Green Ribbon</br>
Hot Glue Gun and Glue</br></br>

Pull apart the flowers and leaves so that you are just left with whole flower heads and stemless leaves. Measure the circumference of your head. Measure out 1.5 times that length in flower wire. Braid three pieces of flower wire that length together to make a strong base. Adjust the braid to your head size and glue the braid into a hoop. Glue the ribbon around the wire. This makes it so that you have ribbon against your head instead of the wire.
</br></br>
Around the base, arrange your leaves and flower heads. Once you are happy with how it looks, start gluing down the leaves. You want it to look full and like the leaves will be poking out from the flowers.  Let this dry. Now carefully glue the flowers into place. Once this is dry, you are done! 
</br></br>
Happy Gluing, Flower Child!

<h1>DIY Snow Globe</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/IMG_3555 copy.JPG" alt="snow globe" style="width:450px"/>
</br></br>
What You Will Need
</br></br>
A Sealable Glass Container with Lid</br>
Waterproof Permanent Glue </br>
Glitter</br>
Clean, Ideally Distilled, Water</br>
Glycerin</br>
Whatever Waterproof Bits and Bobs You Want Inside</br></br>

Clean your glass container and let it dry. Take this time to arrange your bits and bobs into a favorable arrangement. Glue them down to the lid of the container making sure that you leave room on the edges to close it up.
</br></br>
Pour a tablespoon of Glycerin into the jar. Add about two tablespoons of glitter. Now fill the jar up with water and add more glitter if necessary. You want to fill the gar with water all the way to the top. 
</br></br>
Over a sink, close the container up with the lid. Your additions to the lid will push water out, thus the sink. Once closed, let it sit over night to dry, lid on top. Once it’s dry, glue the container shut and wait another day to turn it upside down. Make sure to glue all around the base of the lid, leaving no spaces. If using a mason jar, also glue shut the seam at the top.

<div id="book">
<h1>Tiny Books</h1>
<p>
<img src="img/IMG_4440.JPG" alt="stamps" style="width:450px"/>
</br></br>
What You Will Need
</br></br>
Thread</br>
A Needle</br>
Scissors</br>
Cardstock or Paper of Choice </br></br>

Decide on the length and height of your book. Cut your paper into rectangles the height and twice the intended length. This is because we will be stacking these rectangles and flooding them in half. If you want to have a special cover page, add it at this time. 
</br></br>
To bind the book, pull a length of thread 8 times the height of the book. Thread through the needle and knot the ends of the thread together so that when you pull the needle through the thread is twice as thick. 
</br></br>
Make a small mark every quarter to half inch on the inside crease of your innermost page. This is where your needle will go through. 
</br></br>
Push your needle through all of your pages through the topmost mark. The knot you have made will be here. Next, push the needle from the outermost page inward toward the second mark. The needle will now be on the inside of the book. Push it back through the first hole and then pull back in through the third hole. Then back through the second hole from the inside and pull back through the fourth hole. Continue this pattern. Third to Fifth, Fourth to Sixth, Fifth to Seventh. 
</br></br>
When you get to the bottom, tie it off with a knot and you are done. Fill with whatever you want. 
</br></br>
Happy Book Making!
